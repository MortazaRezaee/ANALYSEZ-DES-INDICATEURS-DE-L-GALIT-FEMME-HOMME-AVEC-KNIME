# ANALYSEZ-DES-INDICATEURS-DE-L-GALIT-FEMME-HOMME-AVEC-KNIME
This repository contains the resources and workflow for automating the creation of a gender equality diagnostic report using KNIME. The project was initiated to support the annual compliance requirement for calculating and publishing the Gender Equality Index for a consulting firm undergoing rapid growth.
Project Background
As a data analyst at a digital transformation consulting firm with over 150 employees, your task is to assist the HR department in developing a comprehensive and automated gender equality report. This report is not only a legal requirement but also a strategic tool for enhancing the company’s employer brand and attracting top talent.

Objectives
KNIME Workflow Development: Create a KNIME workflow that processes HR data from the company’s HR Information System (SIRH) to generate key gender equality indicators.
Data Processing: Ensure all HR data is anonymized to comply with GDPR requirements before generating the report.
Visualization Output: Generate diagnostic charts and graphs within the KNIME workflow, focusing on at least 5 critical indicators for gender equality.
